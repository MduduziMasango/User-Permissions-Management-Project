Windows User & Permissions Management Project Notes
===========================================================

Objective:
Simulate real-world user account and folder permission management on Windows, including user creation, access restriction, troubleshooting access errors, and restoring permissions.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Steps Performed:
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a New Standard User (`TempUser`):
   - Navigated to: Settings > Accounts > Family & Other users
   - Selected “Add someone else to this PC”
   - Chose “Add a user without a Microsoft account”
   - Created a local standard account named: TempUser

2. Create a Folder for Permission Testing:
   - Created: C:\TestAccess
   - Right-clicked > Properties > Security > Edit > Add
   - Added TempUser with initial permission: Read & execute

3. Log in as TempUser and Test Access:
   - Logged out of Admin
   - Logged in as TempUser
   - Verified TempUser could open folder but not create files

4. Simulate Access Denied:
   - Logged back in as Administrator
   - Removed all permissions for TempUser on C:\TestAccess
   - TempUser now received “Access Denied” trying to open folder

5. Restore Access:
   - Reassigned Read & Write permission to TempUser
   - TempUser could now access and modify folder contents

-----------------------------------------------------------
Tools & Skills Demonstrated:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- NTFS folder security settings
- Account provisioning (local standard user)
- Simulating & resolving permission issues
- GUI troubleshooting and permission repair

-----------------------------------------------------------
Lessons Learned:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- How to use Windows to manage local user accounts
- Practical NTFS permission control and inheritance behavior
- Hands-on troubleshooting of access-denied errors
- Principle of least privilege in access control
